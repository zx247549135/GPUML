\section{Conclusion}

In order to mitigate the memory pressure in current data processing systems for service, this paper analyzes the memory usage characters of variety function APIs provided by these systems and build three coarse grained models to classify them, then proposes memory usage rate as a uniform criterion to mark the influence of one task on memory pressure. The memory usage rate based scheduler called MURS can suspend these tasks resulting in heave memory pressure, and speed up these tasks with light memory pressure. MURS can be implemented in most data processing systems.
