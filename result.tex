\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Configuration}

We use four nodes as workers and one node as the master in the experiments. Each node has two eight-core Xeon-2670 CPUs and 64GB memory. The file system is mount on one SAS disk, running RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 (kernel 2.6.18). The JDK version is 1.7.0 for Spark 1.6 and Spark Job Server 0.6.2. We count not only the execution time of each application, but also the details of runtime situations.
